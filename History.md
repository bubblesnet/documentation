## History (i.e. where the bugs come from)
This open-source project is a port and integration of an existing set of unrelated personal projects.  This
original set of projects included:
* Server written in Java J2EE as APIs that write JSON files to filesystem
* File processors written in Java that read/write ActiveMQ, move file data into databases and archive files
* A MySQL database
* An Android/Android Things edge device that itself was a rewrite of a RPi python edge device
