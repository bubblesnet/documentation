# Getting started using the Balena public fleet

BubblesNet runs two public fleets - groups of devices that run the BubblesNet code. These are the 
[edge-device fleet](https://hub.balena.io/organizations/gh_bubblesnet/fleets/bubblesnet3) 
and the [controller fleet](https://hub.balena.io/organizations/gh_bubblesnet/fleets/bubblesnet4_controller_aarch64_prod). 
In order to run an instance of BubblesNet on the public fleets you will need to have one-and-only-one device in the
controller fleet, and one or two devices in the edge-device fleet.
